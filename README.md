[_A Predictive Classification Model of Cervical Cancer Diagnoses_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Cervical-Cancer-Analysis)
````
[The paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVQnFLAQtbFUBalW_boQqgovmGz-N-N1/view?usp=sharing) was concerned
with using classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector Machines) and data
compression methods (Singular Value Decomposition) to build a predictive classification model to predict the
results of a cervical cancer diagnostic test.
