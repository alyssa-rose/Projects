### Personal Projects



### School Projects

[_A Predictive Classification Model of Cervical Cancer Diagnoses_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Cervical-Cancer-Analysis)
  - [The paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVQnFLAQtbFUBalW_boQqgovmGz-N-N1/view?usp=sharing)
````
The project was concerned with using classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and Support Vector
Machines) and data compression methods (Singular Value Decomposition) to build a predictive classification 
model to predict the results of a cervical cancer diagnostic test.

[_Analysis of Global Food Shortages and Needs_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Final-Project-Backup)
````
The project aims to predict global food needs by region and food type for a given year using k-means clustering, interpolation and extrapolation. The data was taken from Kaggle and processed via MATLAB. The program includes a GUI to allow the user to choose the 
region, food type, and year range in order to determine the amount of food (in tons) needed to meet basic needs.
