### Personal Projects

[_Determination of Counties Most in Need of Federal Grants for Infrastructure Projects_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Grant-Funding-)
  * [The paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aZ3uGdiP0iX4fjXO-qjjTwy-4VHwOfaf/view?usp=sharing)
  * [Tableau notebook: Poverty Analysis by County](https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/alyssarose/home)
  
````
The project was built and designed by me after a question posed by my sister (a civil engineer) 
"Why don't more communities with poor infrastructure know about federal grants available for
infrastructure projects?". After delving into the issue further, it was realized that it is
up to the community to write these grants, an issue if the community does not have their
own set of civil engineers to address such problems (which is especially true in poverty
stricken areas). Using web scraping techniques and data from Data.gov, I analyzed the poorest
communities and cross referenced them with those that have the worst infrastructure to determine
where outside help from grant writing companies or civil engineers would be most needed, such
that grants could be written and submitted to the INFRA grant program.

Skills: Python, Web scraping, data preprocessing, Tableau, data analysis

### School Projects

[_A Predictive Classification Model of Cervical Cancer Diagnoses_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Cervical-Cancer-Analysis)
  * [The paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1pVQnFLAQtbFUBalW_boQqgovmGz-N-N1/view?usp=sharing)
  
````
The project was concerned with using classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and 
Support Vector Machines) and data compression methods (Singular Value Decomposition) to 
build a predictive classification model to predict the results of a cervical cancer 
diagnostic test.

Skills: Python, math theory, Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Classification

[_Analysis of Global Food Shortages and Needs_](https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Final-Project-Backup)
````
The project aims to predict global food needs by region and food type for a given year using 
k-means clustering, interpolation and extrapolation. The data was taken from Kaggle and processed 
via MATLAB. The program includes a GUI to allow the user to choose the region, food type, and 
year range in order to determine the amount of food (in tons) needed to meet basic needs.

Skills: MATLAB, data preprocessing, Machine Learning, group work

### Work Projects

_Dense Urban Environment Team (DUET) Human Services Final Report_
 * _CLASSIFICATION: UNCLASSIFIED_
 * _COLLABORATION: United States Department of Defense, United States Army Futures Command, MORS_
 * _Paper : Unpublished currently, cannot share with outside sources_
 
````
A paper done in collaboration with Natalie Wenigmann (Tel Aviv University) and Tom Carpino
(Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health) to build human service models for topics
such as health, food security, and water systems in the AFRICOM, EUCOM AND INDOPACOM regions

The paper will be available on the Military Operations Research Society's (MORS) website 
in the near future
