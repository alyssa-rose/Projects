<p><a href="https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Grant-Funding-"><em>Determination of Counties Most in Need of Federal Grants for Infrastructure Projects</em></a></p>

  <li><a href="https://us-east-1.online.tableau.com/#/site/alyssarose/home">Tableau notebook: Poverty Analysis by County</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The project was built and designed by me after a question posed by my sister (a civil engineer) 
"Why don't more communities with poor infrastructure know about federal grants available for
infrastructure projects?". After delving into the issue further, it was realized that it is
up to the community to write these grants, an issue if the community does not have their
own set of civil engineers to address such problems (which is especially true in poverty
stricken areas). Using web scraping techniques and data from Data.gov, I analyzed the poorest
communities and cross referenced them with those that have the worst infrastructure to determine
where outside help from grant writing companies or civil engineers would be most needed, such
that grants could be written and submitted to the INFRA grant program.

Skills: Python, Web scraping, data preprocessing, Tableau, data analysis

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The project was concerned with using classification methods (Artificial Neural Networks and 
Support Vector Machines) and data compression methods (Singular Value Decomposition) to 
build a predictive classification model to predict the results of a cervical cancer 
diagnostic test.

<p><a href="https://github.com/alyssa-rose/Final-Project-Backup"><em>Analysis of Global Food Shortages and Needs</em></a></p>
<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>The project aims to predict global food needs by region and food type for a given year using 
k-means clustering, interpolation and extrapolation. The data was taken from Kaggle and processed 
via MATLAB. The program includes a GUI to allow the user to choose the region, food type, and 
year range in order to determine the amount of food (in tons) needed to meet basic needs.

Skills: MATLAB, data preprocessing, Machine Learning, group work
